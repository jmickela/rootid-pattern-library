  <p>Essential Access Health's Chlamydia/Gonorrhea (CT/GC) Patient-Delivered Partner Therapy (PDPT) Distribution Program is designed to ensure that exposed sex partners of patients diagnosed with a CT/GC infection receive timely treatment to prevent repeat infection.</p>
  <p>PDPT is <strong>not</strong> intended as a first-line partner management strategy. It is an evidence-based alternative for treating sex partners who are unable or unlikely to visit a health center. This program is intended for uninsured or underinsured sex partners of patients diagnosed with a CT/GC infection.</p>
  <p>Through the CT/GC PDPT Distribution Program, California clinic sites and local health jurisdictions (LHJs) are supplied with free medication to give, when appropriate, to their patients diagnosed with chlamydia and/or gonorrhea. Patients deliver the medication to their sex partners without the partners needing to be examined or evaluated by a clinician prior to treatment. Additionally, LHJs implementing <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept">Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT)</a> programs outside of a clinical setting may provide the free medication to patients and/or their sex partners through <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/GuidelinesForTheTreatmentofCTAndGCCasesAndExposedPartners.pdf" target="_blank">field-delivered treatment (FDT)</a>.</p>
