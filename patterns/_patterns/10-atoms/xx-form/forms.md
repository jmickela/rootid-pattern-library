We've decided not to write a proper form template at this time, as it's really not applicable for us these days. Almost all our form code is either copied and pasted from an outside site or generated by a module/plugin such as Webforms or Gravity Forms.

Therefore, what we're providing here is a very basic hand-coded form that demonstrates some basic form styling and a nice label animation script :)




Thoughts on what a form-creating yml file might look like...

form:
  title: (string)
  id:  -- (string) optional but can be nice for targeting styles
  modifiers -- (array of strings) optional modifier classes
  extra_classes -- (array of strings) optional extra classes
  elements: (array of objects)
    - type:  -- (string: select, textbox, textarea, email, etc) used to select field template
      name:  -- (string) -- to match item and label
      label_text: -- (string) what you want the label to say
      display_label: (bool) whether the label should be displyed
      options -- (array of objects -- only needed for select or radio)
        - label -- (string)
          value
