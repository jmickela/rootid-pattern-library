Alternating Highlights
---

A common pattern our design team uses, features an alternating pattern of a card with a background color
on one side and an image on the other. Typically this is a full with row, so paddings and margins should
be avoided on outer elements.

Basic layout looks like this:

    [ card  ] | [ image ]   
    [ image ] | [ card  ]
    
When this changes to mobile the image should *always* display on top of the card.
