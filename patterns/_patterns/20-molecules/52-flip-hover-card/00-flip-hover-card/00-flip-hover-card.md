Flip Hover Card
----

Essentially Two Cards in one, a front card and a back card, provided as arrays of card data.

On hover the included JS adds a class that flips the card over.

*Known Issues:*

* Requires Specific height to be set.
* Back of card is sometimes visible if heights aren't set correctly or back card doesn't have background set.
* Sometimes flip animation is a little weird, maybe add a debounce or something?
