  naturopathic medical schools with admissions requirements comparable to other medical
  schools.</h4>They study the biomedical sciences—cardiology, neurology, radiology,
  obstetrics, gynecology, immunology, dermatology and pediatrics—- and are trained
  in clinical, laboratory and physical diagnosis. They also study clinical nutrition,
  botanicals, counseling, stress management, and physical medicine. Naturopathic doctors
  are not necessarily “anti-pharmaceutical”– but they are cautious when it comes to
  using drugs, and will always attempt to use the least invasive methods to both diagnose
  and treat One of the main reasons this website exists is to make it possible for
  people who are seeking an alternative to conventional medicine to find practitioners
  who have passed rigorous board exams in naturopathic medicine, and are licensed
  to practice naturopathic medicine in their state. Naturopathic Principles The Power
  of Nature: Naturopathic physicians recognize a person’s innate ability to heal.
  NDs act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery to facilitate this
  inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Cause: NDs seek to identify
  and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or
  suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm: NDs follow 3 precepts to avoid harming the
  patient: (1) utilize methods and medical substances which minimize the risk of harmful
  side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; (2) avoid when
  possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; (3) and acknowledge, respect and work
  with the individual’s self-healing process. Doctor As Teacher: NDs educate their
  patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ
  the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person:
  NDs treat each patient by taking into account many factors including physical, mental,
  emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and spiritual ones. Practice Prevention:
  NDs emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and
  susceptibility to disease, and making appropriate interventions in partnership with
  their patients to prevent illness."
